# ReactDevsKe Weekly Standup Notes - Thursday 26th August 2021

- We briefly discussed about our working experience with [Hasura](https://hasura.io/) and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/).
- We discussed on where each member gets their app/project ideas from.
- We discussed on how each of the members on the session manage their developer time. Some prominent suggestions included:
  - Scheduling time out on your calenders.
  - Using a pomodoro to shift between work time and rest time.
  - setting time for coding when you have other jobs/responsibilities.
